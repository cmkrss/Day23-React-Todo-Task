# Todo List Application

A simple React-based Todo List application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed or not completed using a dropdown menu.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Create new tasks with a name and description.
- **Edit Todos**: Update the name and description of existing tasks.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Filter Todos**: View tasks based on their completion status (All, Completed, Not Completed).
- **Toggle Status**: Change the status of tasks using a dropdown menu.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **UUID**: For generating unique identifiers for tasks.

## Vite Setup

This project is set up using Vite, which provides a fast and efficient development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Vite is configured to work with React for a smooth development experience.
